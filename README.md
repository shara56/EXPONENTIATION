# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: sharangini
#RegisterNumber: 22003363
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:", x**y) 
```

## Output:
![exponentiation1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113497104/192079979-5733eb77-a965-471b-8b70-d228f5200a3a.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
